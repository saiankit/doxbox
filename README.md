# DoxBox

DoxBox is a very handy utility application that allows you to store details of your personal documents ( Aadhar Card, PAN Card, Driving License, etc.) on your mobile phone.
How different is it from storing your documents in image or PDF format?
With DoxBox, since you are storing the details in the form of text, all the document fields are copy-able to the clipboard with a single click, and you need not look at your document image and type them manually. You can have one of the detail as primary detail and have the primary detail on the home screen. All the other details are available inside the document page. You can also favourite some of the documents from your home screen, which are then pushed to the top of the screen for easier access. You can also export and import data from the application, thereby giving you easier access on any mobile you want this app to exist.

You can install the application from APK inside the release page here ðŸ‘‰ https://github.com/saiankit/doxbox/releases/tag/v1.0.0
